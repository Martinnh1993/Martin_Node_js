  <strong>Nodemon:</strong>
  Nodemon is a helpful development tool for Node.js applications. 
  It automatically restarts the Node server whenever it detects changes in your code, 
  providing a convenient way to streamline development without manually restarting the server.
  
  <strong>Loops and Loop Methods in JavaScript:</strong>
  JavaScript offers various mechanisms for creating and managing loops, 
  allowing you to repeat a set of instructions. Loop methods like for, while, 
  and forEach make it possible to iterate over arrays, objects, and other data structures. 
  Understanding how to use loops is crucial for controlling the flow of your code and handling repetitive tasks.
  
  <strong>CRUDable REST API - Part I:</strong>
  In the world of web development, CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
  These operations represent the fundamental actions that can be performed on data in a web application. 
  In this part, you'll learn how to create a RESTful API that allows you to perform these actions. 
  REST (Representational State Transfer) defines a set of conventions for structuring URLs and handling HTTP requests for building web services.
  
  <strong>Anatomy of a URL:</strong>
  A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the web address that identifies a resource on the internet. 
  It consists of several components, including the protocol (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), domain name, path, and query parameters. 
  Understanding the structure of a URL is important for web development, 
  as it's the basis for making requests to web servers and handling routing in your applications.
  
  <strong>Serving HTML in Express:</strong>
  In an Express.js application, you can serve HTML files to clients' web browsers. 
  This is useful for displaying web pages and rendering user interfaces. 
  By sending HTML files as responses to specific routes, 
  you can create dynamic and interactive web applications.
