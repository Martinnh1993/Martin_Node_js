  <strong>Block Scope: </strong>
  Variables declared with let or const are limited to the block (enclosed by {}) they are defined in. 
  They are not accessible outside the block.

  <strong>Function Scope: </strong>
  Variables declared with var have function-level scope. 
  They are accessible within the function in which they are defined.

  <strong>const:</strong>
  const is used to declare variables that should not be reassigned. It is not immutable, 
  meaning you can change the internal properties of a const object.
  const variables are stored in memory, just like other variables.
  var is a globally scoped variable. It is accessible from anywhere in the code.

  <strong>let:</strong>
  let is block-scoped like const, but it can be initialized without a value and can be reassigned.
  Unlike const, you can redeclare a variable using let in the same scope.

  <strong>Hoisting:</strong>
  Hoisting refers to the behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing 
  function or global scope during compilation.
  This allows you to use a function or variable before it's declared in your code.

  <strong>Callback Function:</strong>
  A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function.
  It is often used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, such as in event handling or making API calls.
  
  <strong>NPM Express:</strong>
  Express is a web framework for Node.js. 
  It simplifies building web applications and APIs by providing a set of features and middleware for handling common tasks, 
  such as routing and serving content.

  <strong>Semantic Versioning:</strong>
  Semantic versioning (Semver) is a versioning scheme for software that aims to convey meaning about the underlying changes in a release.
  It typically uses a version number in the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
  Learning Goals:

  <strong>Clean Code: </strong>
  Writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
  ESLint Airbnb: Using ESLint with the Airbnb JavaScript style guide for consistent and clean code.

  <strong>File Naming Convention:</strong>
  Using app.js as the filename is a convention that many Node.js 
  and Express developers follow to make it easy to locate the entry point of an application.

  <strong>Data Format:</strong>
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a versatile data format that is commonly used because it's easily understood by various programming languages, 
  making it a great choice for exchanging data between systems and APIs.
  Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further explanations on any of these topics.
