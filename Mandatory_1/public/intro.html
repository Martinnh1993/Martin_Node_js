      <h2>Intro</h2>

  <strong>Definition of NodeJS:</strong>
  Chrome includes a V8 JavaScript runtime engine.
  Node JS is a runtime environment for JavaScript, taken out of the browser.
  In the past, JavaScript could only run in the browser.
  Node JS can be used to create servers, scripts, apps, terminal applications, and command-line interfaces.
        
  <strong>JavaScript Data Types:</strong>
  JavaScript supports various data types, each serving a specific purpose:
        
    - Number: Used for numeric values, both integers and decimals.
    - String: Represents text and is enclosed in single or double quotes.
    - Boolean: Represents true or false values.
    - Float: A floating-point number, essentially a decimal value.
    - BigInt: Used for very large integer values that can't be represented by the Number type.
    - Undefined: Denotes a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.
    - Null: Represents the absence of any value or object.
    - Symbol: A unique and immutable data type often used as object property keys.
    - Object: An aggregate data type that can hold various data and methods. It includes objects, arrays, symbols, and dates.
       
  Understanding these data types is crucial when working with JavaScript, 
  as it allows you to manipulate data effectively and make informed decisions in your code.
        
  <strong>REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop):</strong>
  REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. It is an interactive programming environment used for testing and executing code snippets. 
  In NodeJS, you can access the REPL environment by simply running the "node" command in your terminal. 
  It's a great way to quickly experiment with JavaScript code.
      
  <strong>HTTP Conventions:</strong>
  HTTP conventions dictate the order of HTTP methods, providing a standardized approach to handling requests. 
  These conventions include:     
    - GET
    - POST
    - PATCH
    - PUT
    - DELETE
        
  Each HTTP method serves a specific purpose, and it's important to follow these conventions when designing web applications. 
  For instance, the GET method is used for retrieving data, while POST is employed for submitting data to be processed.
