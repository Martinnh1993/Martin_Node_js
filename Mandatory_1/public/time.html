    Description:
    This code demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Express.js.
    It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing resources, including creating, reading,
    updating, and deleting resources. Each operation corresponds to a specific HTTP method:
    POST for creating, GET for reading, PUT for updating, and DELETE for deleting.
  
    <span class="comment">// Create: Define a POST route for creating new resources.</span>
    app.post("/resource", (req, res) => {
        // Handle resource creation logic.
    });

    <span class="comment">// Read: Define GET routes for reading resources.</span>
    app.get("/resources", (req, res) => {
        // Handle reading all resources.
    });

    <span class="comment">// Patch: Define a PATCH route for updating existing resources.</span>
    app.patch("/resources/:id", (req, res) => {
        // Handle updating a specific resource by ID.
    });

    <span class="comment">// Update: Define a PUT route for updating existing resources.</span>
    app.put("/resources/:id", (req, res) => {
        // Handle resource update logic.
    });

    <span class="comment">// Delete: Define a DELETE route for deleting resources.</span>
    app.delete("/resources/:id", (req, res) => {
        // Handle resource deletion logic.

  <strong>CRUDable REST API - Part II</strong>
  In this part, we continue building a CRUDable REST API. 
  This section likely covers additional HTTP methods such as POST, PUT, and DELETE to handle the create, 
  update, and delete operations, respectively. It's about extending the API's capabilities.

  <strong>Time</strong>
  The "Time" topic might involve handling time-related operations in your code. 
  Common use cases include scheduling tasks, tracking timestamps, and handling time zones. 
  It's essential for applications with time-dependent functionality.

  <strong>Fetch</strong>
  The "Fetch" topic is related to making HTTP requests in JavaScript using the Fetch API. 
  It includes sending HTTP requests, handling responses, and interacting with external resources. 
  Fetch is essential for client-server communication.

  <strong>Deployment</strong>
  Deployment involves the process of making your application accessible to the public. 
  It includes hosting your application on a web server, configuring domain names, and making your application available to users. 
  Deployment is a crucial step in the software development lifecycle.

  Description:
  This code snippet demonstrates how to work with date and time in JavaScript using the Date object. 
  It showcases different methods to obtain information about the current date and time, 
  including local time strings, UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time, and epoch timestamps. 
  Additionally, it retrieves and displays the current day of the week, 
  providing a basic example of how to work with dates in JavaScript.
  

  <span class="comment">// Locale Time String</span>
  console.log(Date());

  <span class="comment">// UTC</span>
  console.log(new Date());

  <span class="comment">// Epoch timestamp / Unix</span>
  console.log(Date.now());

  <span class="comment">// Retrieve the current day of the week</span>
  const weekdays = ["Søndag", "Mandag", "Tirsdag", "Onsdag", "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lørdag"];
  console.log("Current day of the week:", weekdays[new Date().getDay()]);
